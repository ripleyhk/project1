      Katherine has always had a passion for photography. She still remembers the first camera she received
      on one eventful Christmas morning. Little did her parents know, but they were jump starting her career.

    <img class="about-img" src="/images/katherine_4.jpg" alt="Katherine working at Bonanza">
    <p>
      She's a native of Hendersonville, TN, a quaint suburb of Nashville. With six siblings,
      Kathy always had plenty of subjects to take pictures of!

    <p>
      Growing up, she was always traveling back and forth between Hendersonville and Richmond, Virginia,
      where her grandparents lived. 
      Eventually, Richmond stuck! Now, Kathy lives in Glen Allen, Virginia with her husband, David,
      and their two daughters, Hannah and Rebecca.
